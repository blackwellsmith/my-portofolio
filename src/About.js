            <hr/>
            <p>I am inspired by the technology of our time.
               The way it shapes our lives is undeniable.
               I believe that many services have not been created yet and the future is unwritten.
               Becoming a part of something that improves and adds value to peoples lives or work, would be a great privilege. 
               I possess strong skills in team-building, adaptability and problem solving, that help businesses be more agile and responsive.
               My years of customer service and business operations have lead me to a pretty simple philosophy.
               Customer satisfaction is the ultimate goal of any business.
               Currently I am available for Software Developer positions in the Chattanooga area and would love to work remotely.
               If you have a position available, interested in a website or just want to get a cup of coffee....</p>
